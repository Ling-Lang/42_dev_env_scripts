Before starting container make sure the docker engine is started by using `d_init` or whatever you set your alias to.

Whenever you want to start a docker container navigate to the directory you want the container to be in and run `d_start` or run `d_start` followed by the path of the directory.

run `help` in the docker container to see available aliase
